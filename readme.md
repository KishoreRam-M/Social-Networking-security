### **General Interview Questions & MCQs (Academic + Placement)**

**General Academic Questions:**
1.  Define a social network from a graph theory perspective.
2.  What is the significance of "degrees of separation" in SNS?
3.  List and explain three common types of attacks in social networks.
4.  How does `k-anonymity` contribute to privacy in published datasets?
5.  What is the core difference between authentication and authorization?
6.  Explain the concept of `Trust Propagation` in social networks.
7.  Why is `input validation` crucial for web application security?
8.  What is `rate limiting`, and why is it important for APIs?
9.  Describe the difference between `HTTP` and `HTTPS`.
10. What role does `NGINX` play in the security architecture of a large web application?

**General Placement/Scenario-Based Questions:**
1.  **Scenario:** Your new social network is experiencing a high volume of failed login attempts from various IPs. What steps would you take to investigate and mitigate this?
    * **Answer:** Implement robust rate limiting on the login endpoint, use IP blacklisting for suspicious IPs, integrate with a WAF, monitor logs for unusual activity, possibly introduce CAPTCHA after a few failed attempts, consider geo-blocking if attacks originate from specific regions.
2.  You're building a feature where users can upload profile pictures. How would you ensure the uploaded files don't pose a security risk (e.g., through malware or script injection)?
    * **Answer:** Validate file type on both client-side and server-side (server-side is crucial), sanitize filenames, store files outside the web root, use content-type sniffing, scan files for malware, resize/re-encode images to strip metadata and potential embedded code.
3.  A user reports that their friend can see their "private" posts, even though they set them to "friends only." How would you debug this access control issue in your full-stack application?
    * **Answer:** Check the database relationships and permissions for that user and post. Verify the backend API's authorization logic (e.g., Spring Security `@PreAuthorize` annotations or custom logic). Examine logs for authorization failures or unexpected data queries. Check frontend logic if it's incorrectly filtering data.
4.  Explain how JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) are used for authentication in a full-stack application and their security considerations.
    * **Answer:** JWTs are used for stateless authentication. After login, the server issues a signed JWT containing user claims. The client stores it (e.g., in `localStorage` or `httpOnly` cookie) and sends it with every request.
    * **Security Considerations:** Use HTTPS, store JWTs securely (preferably `httpOnly` cookies), set short expiration times, implement refresh tokens for better security, revoke tokens if compromised (requires a blacklist), ensure strong secret key for signing.
5.  How would you design a "Report Content" feature securely to prevent abuse (e.g., users falsely reporting others)?
    * **Answer:** Implement rate limiting on reporting, require authenticated users to report, store reporter ID, implement a robust moderation system (manual review for multiple reports), use ML for detecting false reports, potentially introduce reputation for reporters.
6.  Your social network has a public API. What measures would you implement to secure it?
    * **Answer:** OAuth2 for third-party access, API keys with rate limits, input validation, output encoding, robust error handling (no sensitive information in errors), WAF, strong authentication/authorization, audit logging, versioning.
